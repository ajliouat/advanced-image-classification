## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- Hugging Face Transformers
- TensorFlow (for data preprocessing)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Training
To train the Vision Transformer (ViT) model:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate the model on the test set:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

### Prediction
To make predictions on new images:
```bash
python scripts/predict.py --image_path <path_to_image>
```

## Data and Model Paths

### CIFAR-10 Dataset
- The CIFAR-10 dataset is automatically downloaded to the `data/cifar-10/` directory when you run the training or evaluation scripts.
- If you want to manually download the dataset, you can get it from [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and place it in the `data/cifar-10/` directory.

### ViT Model
- The trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model is saved to `models/vit_model.pth` after training.
- To use the trained model for evaluation or prediction, ensure the file `models/vit_model.pth` exists. If not, train the model first using:
  ```bash
  python scripts/train.py
  ```

### **Next Steps**
1. **Download the CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   - If you want to manually download the dataset, place it in the `data/cifar-10/` directory.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the training script to generate the `models/vit_model.pth` file:
     ```bash
     python scripts/train.py
     ```

3. **Evaluate and Predict**:
   - Use the trained model for evaluation or prediction as described in the `README.md`.
